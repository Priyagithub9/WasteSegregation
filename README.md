Problem Statement

Now, letâ€™s understand the problem statement, business objective and data to be used for this assignment.

Improper waste disposal contributes to environmental degradation, increased landfill waste and inefficient recycling processes. Manual sorting is labour-intensive, error-prone and costly. An AI-powered waste classification system addresses these challenges by streamlining waste segregation, reducing operational costs and improving recycling rates.
 

Key business benefits include:

Automated waste sorting, cutting time and labour
Increased recycling rated by precise classification of recyclables
Use Cases:

Smart Recycling Bins
Automated Waste Sorting Facilities
Waste Monitoring and Reporting

This project applies deep learning techniques to enhance recycling efficiency, reduce environmental pollution and promote sustainable waste management practices. In this assignment, you will:

Train and fine-tune a CNN model to classify waste such as cardboard, glass, paper and plastic
Evaluate model accuracy using performance metrics such as precision, recall and F1-score
Gain insights into the role of AI in sustainable environmental solutions
